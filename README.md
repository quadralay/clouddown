# Placeholder

This is a placeholder for the clouddown files. The directory
is required for testing.  Utlimately you can either `git clone`
the [clouddown](https://github.com/quadralay/clouddown)
repo contents here, or symlink the files to the directory.

```bash
$ cd {workspace}
$ git clone git@github.com:quadralay/clouddown.git {workspace}/.
$ cd {workspace}/obrien.server/project/javascript/clouddown
$ ln -s  ../../../../clouddown clouddown
```
